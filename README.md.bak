This is a ongoing Portfolio of programming projects I have worked ongoing

## Digital CLock
-Discription:
	-Digital Clock Is a C++ program that is an command line clock that updates every second and you can change the time with the menu. 
	-This will display a clock in both a 12 hr and 24 hr format to the user. The default time is the localtime on the computer. 
-What works well.
	-the funtions that update the time and the functions to convert and display 12hr clock as the backend the code is stored as 24hr fromat.
	-The clock uses threads to update the time every "second" using wait so not 100% accurate but for the scope of the project works well enough. 
-what could use improvement.
 
-what was the most challanging part?
	-The most challanging part to write was figuing out how to implement threads and allow them to operate while still allowing the user to input the time they want.
